## BEAM
**BEAM** - Beyond Earth Aristotle Missions is a Space Technology Student Association in AUTh - Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. There are several projects that have already been completed under the auspicies of BEAM, mainly participating in European programmes and competitions. To learn more about BEAM, you can visit [BEAM Project](https://beamproject.gr/).
BEAM, in collaboration with the **Astrophysics, Astronomy & Mechanics** sector of AUTh's Physics Department, undertakes the implementation of the project **ASTRO**, related to the development and design of a radio telescope.

## ASTRO
**ASTRO** - Aristotle Student Telescope for Radio astronomy Observations is the latest BEAM's project and its target is to construct a radio telescope in Thessaloniki, Greece. Utilizing national and international collaborations of our professors we have the support and guidance of astronomers and engineers with extensive experience in the construction of radio telescopes. The main purpose of the project is to strengthen the educational and research facilities of the AUTh, but also the flourishing of the field of astronomy and more specifically radio astronomy in Greece.
